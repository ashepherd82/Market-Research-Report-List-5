<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Aircraft Duct Couplings Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Thread Type</li><li>Unthreaded Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Aircraft duct couplings come in two main types: Thread type and Unthreaded type. Thread type duct couplings require threads on both ends of the duct to join them together securely. On the other hand, unthreaded type duct couplings do not require any threads and instead rely on a different mechanism to connect the ducts. Both types have their own advantages and are chosen based on the application requirements and preferences of the user.</p></p>
