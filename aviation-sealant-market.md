<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Aviation Sealant Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Organic</li><li>Inorganic</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Aviation sealants can be divided into two main types: organic and inorganic. Organic sealants are made from materials derived from living organisms, such as rubber, silicone, or polyurethane. These sealants are flexible and resistant to UV radiation, making them ideal for applications where movement or expansion and contraction are expected. Inorganic sealants, on the other hand, are made from non-living materials like glass or ceramics. They are often used in high-temperature and high-pressure applications due to their durability and resistance to corrosion.</p></p>
