<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Axial Bone Densitometer Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>DEXA Axial Bone Densitometer</li><li>QCT Axial Bone Densitometer</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Axial Bone Densitometers are devices used to measure bone density in the axial skeleton, which includes the spine and hips. There are two main types of Axial Bone Densitometers - DEXA (Dual-Energy X-ray Absorptiometry) and QCT (Quantitative Computed Tomography). DEXA Axial Bone Densitometers use X-rays to measure bone density and are commonly used for osteoporosis screening. QCT Axial Bone Densitometers use CT scans to measure bone density and are more accurate but less widely available. Both types are essential tools in the diagnosis and monitoring of bone health.</p></p>
