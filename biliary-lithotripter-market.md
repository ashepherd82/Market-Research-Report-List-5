<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Biliary Lithotripter Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Mechanical Lithotripter</li><li>Ultrasonic Lithotripter</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Biliary lithotripters are devices used to break down gallstones in the common bile duct. There are two main types of biliary lithotripters: mechanical lithotripters and ultrasonic lithotripters. Mechanical lithotripters use mechanical force to crush gallstones, while ultrasonic lithotripters use high-frequency sound waves to break them down. Both types of lithotripters are effective in treating gallstones but may be used in different situations depending on the size and composition of the stones.</p></p>
