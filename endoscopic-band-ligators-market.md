<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Endoscopic Band Ligators Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Electric Ligator</li><li>Manual Ligatior</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Endoscopic Band Ligators come in two main types: Electric Ligators and Manual Ligatiors. Electric Ligators are powered by electricity and offer more precise control and efficiency in placing bands during endoscopic procedures. On the other hand, Manual Ligatiors require manual manipulation for band placement but are often more cost-effective. Both types of ligators are essential tools used in gastrointestinal procedures to remove or ligate abnormal tissue or varices. The choice between Electric and Manual Ligatiors depends on the individual preferences and needs of healthcare providers.</p></p>
