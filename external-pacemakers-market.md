<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The External Pacemakers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single Chamber Pacemaker</li><li>Dual Chamber Pacemaker</li></ul></p>
<p><p>External pacemakers can be divided into two main types: single chamber pacemakers and dual chamber pacemakers. Single chamber pacemakers are designed to stimulate either the atrium or ventricle of the heart, while dual chamber pacemakers can pace both the atrium and ventricle. Single chamber pacemakers are more commonly used for patients with less complex heart conditions, while dual chamber pacemakers are typically used for patients with more advanced heart rhythm disorders. Both types of pacemakers help regulate the heartbeat and improve overall heart function.</p></p>
