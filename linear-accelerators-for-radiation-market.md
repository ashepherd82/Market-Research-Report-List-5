<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Linear Accelerators for Radiation Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Low-energy Linacs</li><li>High-energy Linacs</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Linear accelerators for radiation therapy can be categorized into two main types based on energy levels: low-energy Linacs and high-energy Linacs. Low-energy Linacs are commonly used for superficial treatments, where the radiation beam only needs to penetrate shallowly into the patient's skin. On the other hand, high-energy Linacs are utilized for deeper treatments that require the radiation beam to penetrate more deeply into the body, making them suitable for treating tumors located deep within tissues. Both types of Linacs play a crucial role in delivering precise and effective radiation therapy to cancer patients.</p></p>
