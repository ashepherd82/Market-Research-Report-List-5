<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Regenerative Braking Systems Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>ESC Based System</li><li>ABS Based System</li><li>Others</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Regenerative braking systems can be categorized into three main types: ESC based system, ABS based system, and others. ESC (Electronic Stability Control) based systems use sensors to detect wheel rotation and adjust braking force to prevent skidding. ABS (Anti-lock Braking System) based systems prevent wheel lock-up during braking to maintain control. Other regenerative braking systems may include hydraulic regenerative braking and flywheel regenerative braking, among others. Each type offers unique features and benefits for improving vehicle efficiency and safety.</p></p>
