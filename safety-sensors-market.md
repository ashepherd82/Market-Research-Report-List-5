<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Safety Sensors Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Safety Light Curtain</li><li>Safety Laser Scanners</li><li>Single-Beam Safety Sensor</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Safety sensors market consists of various types such as safety light curtains, safety laser scanners, and single-beam safety sensors. Safety light curtains create an invisible barrier using infrared beams, triggering a safety response when the barrier is broken. Safety laser scanners use laser beams to detect objects within a certain range and can adapt to different shapes and sizes. Single-beam safety sensors operate similarly to light curtains, detecting when an object interrupts the beam and activating safety measures accordingly.</p></p>
